# Cleaning, Wrangling, and Visualization
Here are 3 different notebooks that I created concerning how to clean your data, wrangle, and visualize your data.
While these aren't the most fun parts of using python or creating different simple scripts (let alone a some of the fun of object-orientated programming),
as someone who just graduated with a degree in Social Data Science, with a thesis on Generative AI's impact to social dynamics...I'm probably going to 
start working at a company and be doing a lot of data cleaning and some wrangling. Actaully running the data through different types of machine learning or deep learning,
even the use of generative ai, may not be what an entry level employee will be working on. Also, the better the data quality, the better the model. 
Thus, I created this repository just to demonstrate/have for myself some of the basic/best practices on taking care of data. In my repository on [SNA-via-Redit-API](https://github.com/zach-porter/SNA-via-Reddit-Api) or my [ABM](https://github.com/zach-porter/ABM-Networked-Weighted-Balance-Theory), 
you can see more examples of me using cleaning, wrangling and visualizations of data, both real-world data and data from the ABM's simulation.
